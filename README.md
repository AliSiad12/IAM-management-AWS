![Assign MFA device](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26c3dc3a-722c-4029-ac80-39e3da483a2d)

![Type two consecutive MFA codes below](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2db645a6-6ede-4dd6-aa67-492d4f6bffb1)

Summary

This project provided hands-on experience with AWS IAM, including user and role management, custom policies, and MFA setup. It reinforces best practices for securing AWS environments through granular permissions and multi-factor authentication.

Notes: 1-I chose not to include the JSON and YAML files, as their content may vary depending on the specific use case or environment.

The previous steps were designed to achieve the objective in the simplest way possible.
